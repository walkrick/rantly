# Rantly

Welcome to the next big thing. We're going to take on Twitter. Now-a-days everyone wants to communicate online, but they need more space! Twitter just isn't cutting it anymore. We're going to build a solution to that; rant.ly. This platform takes the opposite approach to twitter and forces user's to write *at least* 140 characters. Ha! Take that Twitter.

Help use raise our Series A and get our prototype out. We only have a week to do it! Good luck!
